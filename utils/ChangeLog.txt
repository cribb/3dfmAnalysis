2008-10-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* select_data_in_box.m: added awareness of several series rather than just selecting the first one.

2008-09-16  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* gen_pub_plotfiles.m:  added svg output.

2008-07-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	- select_data_in_box.m: added series handle to output.

2008-07-07  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	see previous entry.  forgot to add files before commit.  done here.

2008-07-07  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* .cvsignore: added.  now cvs ignores .asv and .mat files (for this folder)
	* select_data_in_box.m: added array indicies of selection as an output.
	* pretty_plot.m: added argument handling and generated two pretty_plot types, one for 'screen' and one for nicely rendered 'eps' figures (for publication).
	* gen_pub_plotfiles.m: added.  Uses pretty_plot to generate several files for a given figure.  Pretty much a hack to save myself from repeatedly saving .eps, .png, .jpg, etc... files for the figure.
	* legend_reorder.m: added.  reorders legend entries according to input vector.

2008-05-16  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* count_dlim.m: added.  returns delimiter count per line.

2007-08-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* pretty_plot.m: added exception handling to the changing of figure elements.

2007-05-02  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* slopper.m: Minor changes and a bit cleaning up.

2007-04-02  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* slopper.m: Fixed a bug, now works for both, positive and negative slopes.
	
2007-03-05  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* slopper.m: Added a stand-alone utility to compute/fit slopes of curves.
	Works for linear scale, log scale, and plots with overlayed curves.
	Inspired by bioforcesGUI.

2006-10-26  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* header.m: freshened the output strings so that it makes more sense.
	* pretty_plot.m: increased the font sizes for the text areas of figures.
	
2006-08-07  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* drawlines.m: Now sets the lengths of the lines to whichever is larger, auto axis range and given axis range. This enables to zooming in and out without affecting the lines.	
	
2005-08-07  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* bin2d.m:  now handles edge condition correctly.  (finally found the source of the strange off-by-1 error.

2005-07-31  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
* bin2d.m:  added handling for 'divide by zero' cases.

2005-07-20  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* bin2d.m:  added.  works like griddata for arranging 2D data into a matrix, but instead of just averaging the values in a selected bin, it reports the standard error as well.  Also, interpolation between values is not done. (Use interp2 for this).

2006-05-18  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* parse_csv_int.m: Fixed a bug where multidigit numbers in the string weren't recognized correctly.

2006-05-17  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* parse_csv_int.m: Now also supports colon (:) operator to make a linearly spaced array.

2006-05-17  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* parse_csv_int.m: Corrected documentation.

2006-05-17  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* parse_csv_int.m: Added. A utility that reliably parses a string containing comma (or whitespace) separated integers. 

2005-12-23  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* drawlines.m: Better documentation
	
2005-09-06  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* drawlines.m: There must be an accidental commit of this file which had one line deleted. Fixed it.

2005-08-31  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* drawlines.m: Added ability to tag the lines so that they can be identified later.

2005-08-14  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* drawlines.m: Fixed couple of typos and bugs. Tested for both horizontal and vertical lines now.

2005-08-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* select_data_in_box.m: added.  using the coordinates of two captured mouse clicks, this function returns all of the points in the bounding box.2005-07-27  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* pretty_plot.m: added support for multiple axes in figure (e.g. yy-overlays).
	* figurelist.m: returns a sorted vector containing the handles of all existing matlab figures.

2005-07-19  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* unixutc.m: now it will convert timestamps from YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss.sssss to unixtime AND vice versa.  also updated documentation.

2005-07-13  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* drawlines.m:  	- A tool to draw horizontal (or vertical) lines from specified points on Y (or X) axis. LineStyle and Color can be specified.

2005-05-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* rows.m:  stupid typo.

2005-05-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* rows.m:  added.  returns the number or rows in a matrix.

2005-01-03  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
  * pretty_plot.m: fixed case-sensitive typo; jcribb

2004-06-18  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* Added a file unixUtc.m: Takes time in YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss.sssss format and converts it to the unix time(toal number of seconds elapsed since 1970/01/01 midnight). The output is adjusted assuming that the input time is the local timeat NC, USA or Eastern Standard Time zone. This file is useful in comparing various matlab timestamps to tracking data time stamps.

	* Initial Version
