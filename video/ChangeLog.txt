2006-06-19  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* get_mips.m: now you can choose 'min'imum or 'max'imum intensity projection directly in get_mips.

2005-12-14  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* raw2img.m: added stride parameter.
	* raw_balance_gain.m: for a raw video, this balances the gain values for both channels in each pulnix raw image and saves a new raw file.
	* raw_swaplines.m: for a raw video, this corrects the swapped lines problem for each frame.  This follows the same algorithm in gluitake.

2005-12-05  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* get_mips.m: added start and stop frames to parameter list.

2005-11-16  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

2005-11-15   Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* raw_mean_subtract.m added. performs mean subtraction from a .raw file and saves a new .raw file

2005-11-15  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* enhance_contrast.m: added. increases gain for pulnix .raw files and saves a new .raw file.  maximum pixel value is set to 1 (255).

2005-11-01  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* mip.m: added mean projection image as a mode.

2005-05-16  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* mip.m: adjusted output so that if an output variable is defined, the MIP is outputted as a 2D matrix, otherwise it just displays an image of the MIP.

2005-05-15  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* raw2img.m: fixed a bug that offset the frame number by one.

2005-05-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* swaplines.m: added.  Swaps lines in image(s) if Pulnix misbehaves.

2005-02-11  Ben Wilde <wilde@cs.unc.edu>
	* beadOrbitAngles.m: Added this file, which computes the angle that a bead orbits around a rod.

2005-02-10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* mip.m: fixed time bug for when file started in middle.

2005-02-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* raw2avi.m: added some image processing for handling low-light datasets.

2005-01-26  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* get_mips.m: added.  runs and saves single or batches of max(min)imum intensity projection images.  This function calls mip.m and is for batch processing only.

2005-12-20  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* raw2img.m: set the output of the function to the last image processed.  Useful for immediately looking at an image after conversion.

2004-12-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* mip.m: fixed a bug I introduced by fixing off-by-one error.

2004-12-07  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* balance_pulnix_gains.m: added.  sometimes the image looks banded even after the line-swapping problem is confirmed fixed.  The gains between the two channels on the Pulnix may be off.  You can actually fix this in the camera (where I'm headed after I finish with the data I've already taken).

2004-12-06  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* mip.m: fixed off-by-one error in frame id.

2004-12-01  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* mip.m: fixed error in time calculation.
	* raw2avi.m: removed MPEG4 compression until I can make it actually work.

	* Added mip.m.  Calculates and displays/returns minimum or maximum intensity projection for avi, raw, or stacks of images.

2004-11-29  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* Added playback_data.m.  Creates .avi video of dataset.  Useful for making animations that describe a bead path (beating cilia, for example).

	* Removed make_pulnix_movie.

2004-09-22  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

2004-09-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* Added documentation and removed bug that clipped stacks and movies to 60 frames in make_pulnix_bmps, make_pulnix_tifs, make_pulnix_avi, make_pulnix_movie

2004-09-01  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* Added make_pulnix_bmps and made cosmetic changes to make_pulnix_tifs.
