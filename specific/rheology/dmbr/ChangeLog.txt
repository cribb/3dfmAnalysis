	* dmbr_multi_file_report: fixed GUI filename bugs.
	* dmbr_adjust_report.m: fixed Excel sidebar printout bug.

2012-06-28 Christian Stith <chstith@ncsu.edu>
	* dmbr_multi_file_report: added. allows for multiple files and directories to be run through dmbr_report_cell_expt, creating a single large report.
	* dmbr_adjust_report.m: added. allows for selection of individual sequences for inclusion in report.
	* dmbr_report_cell_expt.m: added comments. improved functionality and allowed for interaction with dmbr_multi_file_report and dmbr_adjust_report.

2012-06-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* dmbr_plot_data.m: displacement plots now show a title with average displacement of last ten data points.

2012-06-13 Christian Stith <chstith@ncsu.edu>
	* dmbr_compute_compliance.m: adapted compliance calculation to approximate compliance for zero-force period
	* dmbr_report_cell_expt.m: added excel output functionality, corrected displacement output

2012-6-11 Christian Stith <chstith@ncsu.edu>
	* dmbr_relaxation_time.m: removed problematic whitespace
	* dmbr_run.m: reimplemented fit function, moved counter to correct position
	* dmbr_report_cell_expt.m:  added.  used dmbr_report to create a new reporting function specifically for the cell pulling experiment as specified by Luke.
	
2011-10-25 Thomas Sayre-McCord <thomassm@email.unc.edu>
	* dmbr_fit.m: added power law fitting to fit options
    	* dmbr_analysis_gui.fig: added "Power Law" as an option in fitting popdown menu

2011-01-18 Thomas Sayre-McCord <thomassm@email.unc.edu>
	* dmbr_compute_compliance: added a method of computing compliance that models a 	bead of radius a as half submerged in the cell. (Currently commented out in 	favor of old method)

2010-11-04 Thomas Sayre-McCord <thomassm@email.unc.edu>
    	* dmbr_direct_moduli: added. computes storage and loss moduli from compliance data, same as direct_moduli
    	* dmbr_analysis_gui: added 'storage and loss moduli' to plotting browser drop down menu
    	* dmbr_plot_data: added 'storage and loss moduli' as a case, uses dmbr_direct_moduli to compute starge and loss moduli, then plots them.

2009-06-16 Stephen Norris <srnorris@email.unc.edu>
	* dmbr_run.m: fixed error for mean curve plotting.
	* dmbr_plot_data: same.
	* Note: These files were actually altered in last commit, but because commit happened recursively, these comments didn't make it in (as they were not made yet).

2009-05-07 Stephen Norris <srnorris@email.unc.edu>
	* .dmbr_todo.txt: added Jeffrey fit viscosity comment 

2009-05-05  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* .cvsignore: added.  
	* dmbr_mean_creep_curves.m: removed.  obsolete.
	* dmbr_compute_mean_curves.m: added.  computes all significant mean values for dmbr datasets.
	* dmbr_plot_data.m: updated to include mean figures and plotting "stacked" sequences.
	* dmbr_analysis_gui.fig: same.
	* dmbr_analysis_gui.m: same.
	* dmbr_report.m: cosmetic changes only.  will soon update this substantially.
	* dmbr_run.m: computes offsets for each sequence/voltage.
	
	
2009-05-04  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* dmbr_plot_data.m: switched to plotting as a position of strain rather than a radial distance.

2009-05-04  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* dmbr_relaxation_time.m: added handling of edge case to avoid error.
	* dmbr_run.m: changed default analyses.
	* dmbr_analysis_gui.fig: prettified gui for linux.
	* dmbr_analysis_gui.m: prettified gui for linux.	

2008-03-04  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* dmbr_plot_data.m: added text annotations that indicate (S)tart and (E)nd points on the shear thinning curve (apparent viscosity vs. max shear rate)

2009-02-26  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* Initial Version of driven microbead rheology analysis package.
