2011-07-01  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msdstat.m:  added.  handles computing statistics on msd datasets.
	* video_msd.m:  added back in the option to record each squared displacment.
	* plot_msd.m:  now uses msdstat instead of computing stats on its own.  added 'u' as a plotting option to plot MSD in microns^2 instead of meters^2
	* ve.m:  removed some old commented out code.

2011-06-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* plot_msd_2pt.m:  added on behalf of Thomas Sayre_McCord.  plots the 2pt MSD as a function of time scale.
	* plot_ve_2pt.m:  added on behalf of Thomas Sayre_McCord.  plots the 2pt Generalized stokes-einstein relation as a function of frequency.

2011-05-05  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* plot_msd.m:  added trackerID values to 'DisplayName' for each MSD curve.  Identifies each MSD curve for better traceback along analysis pipeline.

2011-02-10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* video_msd.m:  modified the scheme for determining tau windows.  The window input parameter, when a scalar denotes the number of window sizes desired from the minimum and maximum available (with repeats filtered out).  When 'window' is a vector, the old default behavior takes over, where the vector contains the exact window sizes of tau when computing the MSD. 

2011-01.13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* getMSDslope.m: added.  souped up way of computing alpha values that uses brian eastwoods edge_detector_1d code.  Originally Ricky Spero's code, I've tweaked it and added it here. Computing the GSER (ve.m) now uses this method.

2011-01-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m: removed cvs diff text.
	* ve.m: same.

2011-01-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m:  now tallies the number of estimates per tau and provides as output.  Used to compute weighted statistics.
	* video_msd.m: now computes weighted statistics so that the mean and error for the MSD are better influenced by the number of individual bead measures. 
	* plot_msd.m: also updated for new statistics measures and tweaked plots.
	* ve.m: changed to use the mean MSD as an imput instead of the individual MSD curves for each bead.  Takes advantage of weighted statistics to minimize bias/error.  Estimates error differently, now propagates max.min MSDs through the GSER function.
	* plot_ve.m: alse uses new stats measures and tweaked plots.
	
2010-09-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m:  added the 'winedge' functionality that limits each path to window sizes that are some factor smaller than the path length.  The default size is '1' that replicates previous behavior.  To restrict a path's windows to 80% of the path-length, set to '0.8'.
	* plot_msd.m: clarified documentation.
	* sim_msd.m: modified call to 'sim_newt_fluid' for the new 'numpaths' argument.
	* ve.m: added an argument that eliminates data points that have less than a desired population size.
	* video_msd.m: added usage of 'winedge' from msd.m and 'nmin' from ve.m.

2009-09-04 Ricky Spero <rspero@physics.unc.edu>
	* msdt.m Numerous minor modifications. Commented code, added x and y outputs for greater flexibility in usage.

2009-05-22  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m: fixed bug that was doubling MSD of x instead of looking at both x and y.

The result was a bug where mean, std, etc... were not computed correctly without identifying the direction these operations should act on.  This update also allowed the code to look much cleaner because there was no need to transpose and re-transpose all of these values.

2006-08-01  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* msdbase.m: 
	- Turned off interpolation when timestamps are uneven. Instead just warns on console and computes the error in Tau.
	- Reports error in Tau.
	* laser_msd_crossover.m:
	- Added. A utility that computes average msd for an ensemble of tracking files. 
	- Computes msd for bead position, position error and stage position and plots them to show crossover.
	- Handy to determine feedback bandwidth.
	* laser_msd.m:

2006-06-05  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>

	- Essentially rewrote the whole module. Now allows to look at diffusion along each axis (X,Y,Z) as well as in each plane (XY, YZ, ZX) independently.
	- Output interface had to be changed to report 1D and 2D diffusion parameters
	- Corrected documentation to reflect changes in the interface.

	* ve.m: used real component when plotting errorbars to avoid "plotting neg (imag) parts in log space" warning.
	* rod_ve.m: same.

2006-01-21  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m: switched to use of "NaN" functions so that it is no longer required for all trackers to exist for all known time points for mean-square displacement and viscoelastic methods.  The standard error reported by the code is weighted by the number of existing datapoints for each window size rather than the global number of trackers for the entire input dataset.
	* ve.m: same.

2005-10-05  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* ve.m: rearranged output data structure such that each bead's data is stored in 'raw', the mean values in 'mean', and the standard error values in 'error'.

2005-08-10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* ve.m: fixed a warning regarding the use of the variable 'gamma' which is also a function in matlab.

2005-06-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* msd.m: vectorized innermost for-loop so that msd runs more quickly.

2005-06-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m: added.  Reimplemented algorithm for computing mean-square displacement as found in Mason's 2000 Rheol Acta paper.  Mostly done for better understanding of the algorithm, but placed here as it works cleanly with the new version of load_video_tracking.
