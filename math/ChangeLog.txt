	* stderr.m: added.  couldn't find a stderr function, it's easy enough to make one, and makes the code (and intent) easier to read.

2008-07-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* mavg.m: added.  simple function that computes moving averages via convolution.

2008-01-24  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* distance.m: submitting Lauren Hartle's new algorithm for this function.  vectorized and much faster.

2006-08-28  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* uncertainty_in_linefit.m: added.  reports error in slope and intercept for a linear fit.

2006-08-25	Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* radialpos.m: Added. A function heavily used by Laser Tracking Analysis GUI to compute radial distances (in plane as well as in 3D) from position coordinates.

2006-07-18  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* uncertainty_in_slope.m: added check for data of reasonable length for error determination and implemented messaging.

2005-10-31  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* windiff.m: minor changes to make code more readable.

2005-10-07  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* distances.m: added.  simply computes the distance between two points in three dimensions (rectangular coordinate system).

2005-07-27  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* uncertainty in slope.m: added.  returns the uncertainty in the slope of a linear fit.

2005-06-16  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* windiff.m: the dependent variable can now have more than one column (e.g. x & y coordinates) 

2005-05-21  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* phase.m: added new documentation and used quadrant-aware atan function.

2005-01-20  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* randwalk.m: added magnitude to the randomizer.  Some returned clock values were returning identical seed values to the random number generator.  bad.
	* windiff.m: added the new grid to the return values.

2004-12-06  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* randwalk.m: vectorized random walk so that it runs faster in matlab.

2004-11-17  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* windiff.m: updated documentation; switched inputs for consistency.

2004-10-26  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* windiff.m: fixed a bug that incorrectly assigned grid values.  fixed documentation.

2004-10-23  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* windiff.m: added.  computes a numerical derivative over some window size.

2004-09-01  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* added heavi.m, which will output Heaviside function with delay.

2004-05-18  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* Initial Version
