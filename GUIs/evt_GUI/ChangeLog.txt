	* evt_GUI.fig: same.

2011-06-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_GUI.m:  removed dummy variable references, i.e. the squiggle "~", because lots of users don't have matlab with a late enough release version to use that feature.

	* evt_GUI.m: uses ntau to automatically generate an MSD or GSER plot with evenly spaced time scales that extend from the minimum tau to maximum tau.  The number 'ntau' is not strictly obeyed, i.e. repeated taus are filtered out.
	* TODO: updated.

2011-02-10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_GUI.m: the windows for MSD and GSER plots are now equally spaced for the loglog representation.

    - can now plot viscoelastic profiles (G and eta, complex) as functions of frequency via the Generalized Stokes-Einstein Relation (GSER).
    - added the pole_locating function for driven bead experiments.

	* evt_gui.m: added axis labels to XY figure.

2007-04-05  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: lots of changes.
			- figures opened by evt_gui now close automatically upon exit.
			- renamed RTfigure to AUXillary figure to contain non-imperative data, such as radial displacement or trackers vs frame#.

			- trimming data now works in pixel and micron length scales.
			- selecting closest dataset now works in pixel and micron length scales.
			- exporting a single bead to the base workspace now works.
			- removed magnet log overlay.  no one uses it.  if it becomes necesary, it can be reinstated.

			- added commenting to old code as new code was written.
	* evt_gui.fig: same.

2006-03-27  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: removed code for "Close All Figures" button.  Now, the existence of an XY, XT, or RT figure is checked and used if exists, otherwise it generates a new figure.  Reduces the number of open figures.

2006-02-03  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* evt_gui.m:  fixed bug in plotting the radial vector.

2005-10-06  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m:  added drift subration methods: 'linear' for removing the linear drift associated with each bead individually and 'center-of-mass' for removing drift along the center of mass vector. added controls for superimposing magnet log data on top of displacments (not yet fully implemented).  Added controls for displaying displacement data in 'microns' instead of 'pixels.'
	* evt_gui.fig: same.

2005-09-22  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* evt_gui.fig: same.

2005-08-11  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: removed a duplicate function name to get rid of annoying warning messages.

2005-08-10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: added code that plots time using the first time point as zero.  This was done to offset the change made in glui_take, where the recorded timestamps are now in UCT.

2005-07-27  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: improved filename/filetype handling.  improved but did not completely fix the plotting update problem (where a deleted point is not removed from a plot until focus is removed from that tracker).

2005-06-16  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: improved the way intensity projection images are included in editing video tracking files.
