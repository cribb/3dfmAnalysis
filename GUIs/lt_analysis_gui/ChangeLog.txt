	* lt_analysis_gui.m, lt_analysis_gui.fig:	
	- Fixed a bug while loading a file that is already loaded in the database.
	- Now shows 'red' background while busy computing, so that user doesn't accidentally click everywhere.
	- Fixed a typo where instead of disabling 'overlay mags' functionality, program enabled it causing a crash later on.

2006-06-09 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:	
	- Fixed a bug in plotting spectrogram in log scale. Also, default view is set back to looking down from top, since 3D view wasn't much helpful.
	- Commented out the code for plotting energy vs time. Will add back after putting a checkbox in the advanced option window.
	- Fixed the annoying delay that happened when trying to draw a new box when one box already exists. Now first deletes the old box before switching to 'drag box' mode.

2006-06-09 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>

	- Now spectrogram is plotted as a surface (instead of colormap) and in log scale.
	- Commented out overlaying of position data on spectrogram, doesn't go well with surface.
	- Added a routine that computes and plots energy vs time. This may just be temporary.

2006-06-06 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Now uses 'bone' colormap instead of 'gray' for spectrogram.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: minor cosmetic changes.

	- Added a checkbox to let user specify if the stage position needs to be filtered or not, at the time of loading the file itself.
	- Added ability to view spectrogram. (only one file at a time, no overlay). Useful to quickly diagnose frequency sweep data.
	- Removed frequency response checkbox. A whole new sub-gui serves its purpose now.
	- several other minor modifications here and there.

2006-04-28 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Turned off 'pretty_plot' command for main figure. According to profiler it was taking a long time to execute. Should came back to it and find out why.

2006-04-21 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Turned off filtering of stage. Untill this option is made accessible through GUI, filtering would have to be done manually. Automatic filtering seems to be a bad idea when tracking is lost and the originial file contains uneven time-stamps for a small span.

2006-04-21 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Sets and supplies correct flags to load new or edited files. Comaptible with load_laser_tracking 02.01
2006-04-14 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Offset in the .drift. field is now set to zero, so that dependent codes don't have to add it back manually while subtracting drift using 'polyval'. Related changes allover.

2006-04-13 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Fixed a bug so where 'magdata' field was left empty when there was no magnet data attached to it. Now defaults to zero.

2006-04-11 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m, lt_analysis_gui.fig: 
	- Loads and saves files correctly

	- Now doesn't refresh time-domain plots automatically when any setting is changed. Added a separate button for that.
	- Incorporated msdbase code (soon to be committed) into gui.
2006-01-28 Kalpit Desai <kvdsai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:

	- Fixed a bug in plotting of multiples PSDs of lowbandwidth dat2
	- Fixed a crash that happened when user 'cancelled' edits of tag.
	- Now 'Cut' allows to select a point outside axis as the boundary. Useful when we want to remove all the data before or after certain time.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: 'Overlay Ch 8' renamed to 'Overlay Mags'

2006-01-27 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
